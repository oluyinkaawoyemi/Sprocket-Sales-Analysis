From the chart above, we could see that the QLD even though has more land mass did not match up in profit with NSW. The marketing team needs to improve on the strategy being used in QLD while maintaining NSW and making sure profit doesn't drop.

The chart above shows that the Mass Customer buys more than the Affluent or High Networth customers. Without this analysis, it would've been an uphill task explaining how the mass customer buys more.

## RECOMMENDATTIONS

The business marketing team has been armed with factual data that has been analysed to make strategic business decisions and have answered problem questions asked earlier such and where profit was highest, who buys more and where they worked. By knowing what industry more profit came from, it serves as a pointer in what direction the marketing team needs to intesify advertising to reach more people.
